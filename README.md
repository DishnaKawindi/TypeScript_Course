# TypeScript Crash Course

This is a TypeScript crash course completed with Node.js. '/03PureTS/src' contains all the original TS files and compiled JS files are saved in '/03PureTS/dist'. The project is designed to run locally with `npm` and can be extended or deployed as needed.

## Tech Stack

- **Languages:** TypeScript
- **Build/Tools:** Node.js, npm

## Setup

Clone the repository and install dependencies:

```bash
git clone (repo_link)
cd folder_name
npm install
```

Then start the server and keep the tsc watch mode running (if modifying the code)
```bash
npm start
tsc -w
